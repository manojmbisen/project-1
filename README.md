Integration of Jenkins with Terraform enables seamless automation of infrastructure provisioning as part of a CI/CD pipeline. Jenkins serves as the automation server to orchestrate tasks, while Terraform acts as the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool to provision and manage infrastructure. By integrating the two, teams can:

Automatically apply Terraform configurations upon code commits or pull requests.
Use Jenkins pipelines to validate Terraform plans before deployment.
Enable repeatable and consistent infrastructure deployments.
Track and manage infrastructure changes through Jenkins build logs.
