Project1--> Integration of Jenkins with Terraform

Pre-requestics:
1.	A/c on AWS 
2.	GitHub a/c required and in that create one new repository
3.	Create an EC2 server with minimum 2cpu and memory. (ex. t2.medium)
4.	In that server Install Jenkins , terraform and git (In linux machine by default the git is install if not install then only we have to install it).
5.	Attache Role “EC2fullaccess” to Jenkins server


Step1:-

When server is ready install the Jenkins and terraform
For Jenkins:-
We required to Install the openjdk (ex. jdk11, jdk17, jdk21)
Cmds.
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install Jenkins -y 
sudo systemctl enable Jenkins.service
sudo systemctl start Jenkins.service
sudo systemctl status Jenkins.service


Note:- Jenkins by default runs on port no. 8080

           Step2:-
Install terraform on the same server where jenkins is running.

wget -O - https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform -y

Step3:-
Configure the Jenkins
Copy the your server public ip 
http://public_ip:8080
for example:-
http://44.211.44.24:8080/

Go to the path while the Jenkins start it will provide you the password and copy that password and paste their .
Create the user, fill all details which is asked, Its depends on you.

Select  Install suggested plugins. It will install some default plugins. And start the jenkins
After That we have to install some requireds plugins for that we have to go to the

Manage Jenkins--- Plugins--->Available Plugins-terraform--install

Wait for few seconds it will install the terraform plugins . I you have to validate it then go to the installed plugins and check for the terraform.

After that we have to configure it , again we have to go to,

Manage Jenkins- Tools-at last we see the terraform installation-add terraformuncheck install automatically--Name:-terraform
Ins install directory we have to give the path like /usr/bin/-- apply and save.

Create new Pipeline go to the 
New items-- give the name of the pileline--- pieline-ok

pipeline {
    agent any
    tools {
     terraform 'terraform'
 }

    stages {
        stage('git checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', changelog: false, poll: false, url: 'https://github.com/manojmbisen/project-1.git'
            }
        }
         stage('terraform Initialitation') {
            steps {
                sh 'terraform init'
            }
        }
         stage('terraform plan') {
            steps {
                sh 'terraform plan'
            }
        }
         stage('terraform provisioning') {
            steps {
                sh 'terraform apply --auto-approve'
            }
        }
    }
Now Build the pipeline and execute the pipeline
